I often come across processes still running after I closed down my `vscode`. Typically, something running on port 3000 or 8000. Depending on the type of project I was working on. I've been using the same snippet for the past couple of years and as my computer gets slower and slower, I thought that I should document it here so when my laptop does eventually give out, I still have it.

To get a list of your running processes on a specific port, in your terminal run the following.

```bash

lsof -i:3000
```

_The above will list out anything running on port 3000._

If there is anything actively running on that port it will log a bunch of information about the process to your console. Locate the `PID` and jot it down.

Next, in your terminal, you can run

```bash
kill -9 {PID}
```

_Replace `{PID}` with your actual PID._

and that's it! That should kill your running process in a `bash` or `zsh` shell. Sorry windows people, I don't know what the equivalent for windows is. If anyone knows, reach out and I can update this.
