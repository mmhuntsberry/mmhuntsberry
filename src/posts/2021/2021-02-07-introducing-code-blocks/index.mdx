This is the first post to contain code block. What should be the first code block to be add to our Digital Garden. It seems only fitting to have:

```js
export const sayHello = (name = "World!") => <h2>Hello {name}</>;
```

```bash
npm install prism-react-renderer

```

```js
const add = (n1, n2) => {
  return n1 + n2;
};
```

```css
.dark {
  background-color: var(--ui-primary);
  color: var(--ui-secondary);
}
```
